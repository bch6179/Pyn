Analyse the result and conduction one step
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. --CMU 15-121 Binary Trees
I used a helper function to return the height of current node. According to the definition, the height of leaf is 0. h(node) = 1 + max(h(node.left), h(node.right)).
The height of a node is also the its index in the result list (res). For example, leaves, whose heights are 0, are stored in res[0]. Once we find the height of a node, we can put it directly into the result.
UPDATE:
Thanks @adrianliu0729 for pointing out that my previous code does not actually remove leaves. I added one line node.left = node.right = null; to remove visited nodes
My version is to really checking the leaves or already in set,and repeatedly call dfs in a while root: which uses O(n) space
