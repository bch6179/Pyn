decrease and conquer  log(m+n), every time call getkth can reduce the scale k to its half
 recursively: getKth 
  even  getKth
  odd   getKth + getKth /2.0
 iteration:  invariants:
     split two halfs and merge left and right
     edge elements less than another 
      while i min < i max (m)
          adjust imin imax based on the property
           imin = i+1

       imax = i+1
