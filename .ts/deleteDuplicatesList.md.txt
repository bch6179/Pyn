#Note : Change cur next pointer to next unique one or Null, 
change cur to that one as new iteration point and repeat
#Mistake prefer looking backward let next iteration start node be the non duplicated one which is p or null; instead of pointing head to next of head.
// [1 1 1] last 1 head== null, and you goback to check head.next , exception
2.
#===== Inner while checking duplicates help to handle the last duplicates by setting tale to null
however, not for one unique while. special handling
3.
p = head.next.next don't set p unless it's already reflected in the head.next 
if you use a variable, make sure the change and reset works
