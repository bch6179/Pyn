isValidProblem: fasan for analyzing different cases, tight on implementation 

completeProlbem: relax on requirement first and then add constrain; convert to isValidProblem subproblems and resolve

dig the assumption you made and explore other optimal assumption if has to be made then verify , or the actual property as shortcut which can be identified by drawing from different cases , like alien order , the assumption is wer, wrt, get the oder from in-word, but not intra word, that lead to incorrect result

complexProblem: select each to AG

canProblem

HardProblem no hint: hashmap , bit, math ,D&D (transfer to ordered data to do merge), setup model comes into play to transform the problem

Infinite problem:
Instead of a two-dimensional array of ones and zeros, I represent the board as a set of live cell coordinates.
