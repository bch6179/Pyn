# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum

# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

# For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
# the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

#not avoid the complexity of getting start and end, while only asking for length
#should merge two loops by one together
#should sum -nums[i] inside the loop and check to save overhead
#greedy get min len before shrinking the left border
