Hash the number of times each character appears in p. Iterate over s with a sliding window and maintain a similar hash. If these two hashes are ever the same, add that to the result.

Each of the hashes have a finite (a-z, A-Z) number of possible characters, so the space used is O(1)

We iterate over s linearly, comparing constant length hashes at each iteration so each iteration is also O(1), so the runtime is O(n)

Same idea from a fantastic sliding window template, please refer:

Time Complexity will be O(n) because the "start" and "end" points will only move from left to right once.
