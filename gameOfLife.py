o solve it in place, we use 2 bits to store 2 states:

[2nd bit, 1st bit] = [next state, current state]

- 00  dead (next) <- dead (current)
- 01  dead (next) <- live (current)  
- 10  live (next) <- dead (current)  
- 11  live (next) <- live (current) 
In the beginning, every cell is either 00 or 01.
Notice that 1st state is independent of 2nd state.
Imagine all cells are instantly changing from the 1st to the 2nd state, at the same time.
Let's count # of neighbors from 1st state and set 2nd state bit.
Since every 2nd state is by default dead, no need to consider transition 01 -> 00.
In the end, delete every cell's 1st state by doing >> 1.
For each cell's 1st bit, check the 8 pixels around itself, and set the cell's 2nd bit.

Transition 01 -> 11: when board == 1 and lives >= 2 && lives <= 3.
Transition 00 -> 10: when board == 0 and lives == 3.
To get the current state, simply do

board[i][j] & 1
To get the next state, simply do

board[i][j] >> 1
Hope this helps!

Here is (quite verbose) translation to Java:

    private Set<Coord> gameOfLife(Set<Coord> live) {
        Map<Coord,Integer> neighbours = new HashMap<>();
        for (Coord cell : live) {
            for (int i = cell.i-1; i<cell.i+2; i++) {
                for (int j = cell.j-1; j<cell.j+2; j++) {
                    if (i==cell.i && j==cell.j) continue;
                    Coord c = new Coord(i,j);
                    if (neighbours.containsKey(c)) {
                        neighbours.put(c, neighbours.get(c) + 1);
                    } else {
                        neighbours.put(c, 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        Set<Coord> newLive = new HashSet<>();
        for (Map.Entry<Coord,Integer> cell : neighbours.entrySet())  {
            if (cell.getValue() == 3 || cell.getValue() == 2 && live.contains(cell.getKey())) {
                newLive.add(cell.getKey());
            }
        }
        return newLive;
    }
where Coord is:

    private static class Coord {
        int i;
        int j;
        private Coord(int i, int j) {
            this.i = i;
            this.j = j;
        }
        public boolean equals(Object o) {
            return o instanceof Coord && ((Coord)o).i == i && ((Coord)o).j == j;
        }
        public int hashCode() {
            int hashCode = 1;
            hashCode = 31 * hashCode + i;
            hashCode = 31 * hashCode + j;
            return hashCode;
        }
    }
and the wrapper:

    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        Set<Coord> live = new HashSet<>();
        int m = board.length;
        int n = board[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i<m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 1) {
                    live.add(new Coord(i,j));
                }
            }
        };
        live = gameOfLife(live);
        for (int i = 0; i<m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j<n; j++) {
                board[i][j] = live.contains(new Coord(i,j))?1:0;
            }
        };
        
    }

    def gameOfLifeInfinite(self, live):
        neighbors = collections.Counter()
    for i, j in live:
        for I in (i-1, i, i+1):
            for J in (j-1, j, j+1):
                if I != i or J != j:
                    neighbors[I, J] += 1
    new_live = set()
    for ij in neighbors.keys():
        if neighbors[ij] == 3 or neighbors[ij] == 2 and ij in live:
            new_live.add(ij)
    return new_live


    r the second follow-up question, here's a solution for an infinite board. Instead of a two-dimensional array of ones and zeros, I represent the board as a set of live cell coordinates.

def gameOfLifeInfinite(self, live):
    ctr = collections.Counter((I, J)
                              for i, j in live
                              for I in range(i-1, i+2)
                              for J in range(j-1, j+2)
                              if I != i or J != j)
    return {ij
            for ij in ctr
            if ctr[ij] == 3 or ctr[ij] == 2 and ij in live}
And here's a wrapper that uses the above infinite board solution to solve the problem we have here at the OJ (submitted together, this gets accepted):

def gameOfLife(self, board):
    live = {(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(board) for j, live in enumerate(row) if live}
    live = self.gameOfLifeInfinite(live)
    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j in range(len(row)):
            row[j] = int((i, j) in live)



hanks a lot your sharing.

The nnb function may not be necessary. Here is how I did it. It seems list comprehension is quite efficient in python. It takes 40ms and beat 100%

        m = len(board)
        n = len(board[0])
        if m == 0 or n == 0:
            return 
        for iM in range(m):
            for iN in range(n):
                numNeighbor = sum([board[i][j]%2 for i in range(iM-1,iM+2) for j in range(iN-1,iN+2) if 0 <= i < m and 0<= j < n]) - board[iM][iN]
                if board[iM][iN] == 0 and numNeighbor == 3:
                    board[iM][iN] = 2
                if board[iM][iN] == 1 and ( numNeighbor < 2 or numNeighbor >  3):
